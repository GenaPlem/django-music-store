# M-TUNE E-commerce Store

![M-TUNE Logo](documentation/images/design/ami_responsive.png)

Welcome to [M-TUNE](https://m-tune-d4849222b5e5.herokuapp.com/), your one-stop online shop for musical instruments and accessories. Our platform offers a seamless shopping experience with a wide range of products, from guitars to drum sets, all available at the click of a button.

## UX

Our philosophy in designing M-TUNE was rooted in simplicity and user-friendliness. We understand that a complex design can overwhelm and deter potential customers, which is why we've embraced a straightforward approach to our e-commerce platform. Our goal is to create an inviting environment that encourages users to explore and purchase musical instruments with ease.

Upon arrival, visitors are welcomed by a sleek and prominent image that encapsulates the spirit of music, accompanied by our tagline "Feel the rhythm, embrace the sound." This imagery, along with a clear call-to-action button, swiftly guides users to our product page. This streamlined entry point ensures that users have immediate access to our product range without unnecessary distractions.

Navigational simplicity is at the heart of M-TUNE. Users can effortlessly add items to their basket from product listings and detailed product pages. The shopping basket is a constant presence within the navigation menu, accessible from every page, reinforcing transparency and trust by displaying a running total. This feature aligns with our commitment to honesty and customer empowerment, avoiding any hidden costs that could surface during checkout.

Our intuitive main navigation menu is engineered for ease, allowing users to find and filter musical instruments and accessories by category with just a click. This ease of access is mirrored in the site's footer, where additional filtering options are available, enhancing discoverability and user autonomy.

In addition to these features, M-TUNE has a unique touch for music enthusiasts. Just as retro gamers have their Konami code, our users can find special interactive surprises that resonate with the musical community, fostering a deeper connection with our audience.

The M-TUNE experience is crafted to be seamless and engaging. With user-centric design, straightforward navigation, and a sprinkle of playful elements, we believe that our site not only meets the needs of our customers but also provides a delightful journey from the first note to the final purchase.

## ðŸ”¥ Important: Payment Processing with Stripe

> **Note:** The following section is particularly crucial as it outlines the plans for a significant improvement in payment system's integrity and reliability.<br><br>
> **Important Context:** Due to an extremely tight deadline for this project, the enhancement of the payment processing system described below has been identified as a priority for the next development phase. The current implementation is functional, but I aim to refine this feature to align with best practices as I continue to improve my project.

Currently, M-TUNE utilizes Stripe for secure online payment processing. During the testing phase, it was observed that while Stripe handles invalid payment data robustly, the user interface does not always reflect the backend validation accurately. This means that, in some cases, the payment may appear to be successful on Stripe's end, but the user might receive an error due to invalid data entry on the checkout form.

### Current Implementation

The present system employs JavaScript to facilitate client-side confirmation of payments. While this method is in line with the practices taught in the Boutique Ado project, I've noted that it may not be entirely suitable for real-world scenarios where stringent validation and error handling are crucial.

### Planned Improvements

In light of this, the following steps are planned to enhance the payment process:

- **Backend Validation**: Transitioning from a client-side to a server-side validation model for payments. This aligns with Stripeâ€™s recommendations and ensures that the payment process is only completed once all the form data has been validated by the backend, preventing any discrepancies.
- **Comprehensive Stripe Integration**: Dedicating time to delve deeper into Stripeâ€™s extensive documentation to fully leverage its capabilities. The goal is to implement a more robust payment system that aligns with real-world e-commerce standards.
- **Continuous Testing**: Implementing rigorous testing for all possible checkout scenarios to ensure a seamless and error-free user experience.

### Acknowledgement 

I acknowledge that the current payment process, as per the Boutique Ado walkthrough, served as a solid foundation. However, for M-TUNE to thrive in a real-world environment, it is essential to adopt a more thorough approach. The commitment to revising our Stripe integration reflects our dedication to providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly shopping experience.

  - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
  - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
